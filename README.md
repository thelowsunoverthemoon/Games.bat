# Games.bat

This is a collection of finished Batch games that aren't just text RPGs. You can find them with their own game pages [here](https://lowsun.itch.io/). It's always fun to create programs that people usually don't associate with Batch, and here are some of them. I plan on creating a lot more games with different genres - space shooters, match 3 puzzles, or maybe even autochess.

## List of Games
* [Dodge Dungeon](DodgeDungeon) : Isometric Bullet Dodging Game
* [Love, Kyoko](LoveKyoko) : Cyberpunk Rogue-like
* [Prism Song](PrismSong) : Boss-rush Platformer
* [Soul Lapse](SoulLapse) : Standard JRPG with Gachas
* [Ziggurat](Ziggurat) : 2 Player Fantasy Rogue-like
* [girl & the rain](girl&therain) : Story based Rain Simulation
