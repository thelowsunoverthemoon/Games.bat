This is a collection of my finished Batch games that aren't just text RPGs. You can find them with their own game pages [here](https://lowsun.itch.io/). It's always fun to create programs that people usually don't associate with Batch, and here are some of them. I plan on creating games with different genres - card games, tower defense, or maybe even autochess.

If you like smaller, more retro games see [Arcade.bat](https://github.com/thelowsunoverthemoon/Arcade.bat).
