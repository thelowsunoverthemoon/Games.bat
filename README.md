<p align="center">A Collection of Games using Batch and VT100 escape sequences</p>
<p align="center">⚠️ Windows 10 only ⚠️</p>

This is a collection of finished Batch games that aren't just text RPGs. You can find them with their own game pages [here](https://lowsun.itch.io/). It's always fun to create programs that people usually don't associate with Batch, and here are some of them. I plan on creating a lot more games with different genres - space shooters, match 3 puzzles, or maybe even autochess.

If you like smaller, more retro games see [Arcade.bat](https://github.com/thelowsunoverthemoon/Arcade.bat).
