# Heyy...
- Hey, how's it going[
@ sad
# Ughh...
# Just got rejected
# From another internship..
# It's fine. Whatever..
- Yeah, it sounds exhausting.
- I mean, I know a lot
- Of people who are also struggling
- To find one.
# It doesn't seem like it..
# Just look on Linkedin and
# Everyone is at big tech
# Getting big offers...
# Meanwhile here I am just
# Finishing school...
# No idea what I'm doing after this..
- To be fair, it's Linkedin
- The people who post there obviously
- Are the ones who have great offers
- Or else why would they post[
- It's just a horrible echo chamber.
# Part of that's true but...
# Still.
# Maybe it's just the
# Expectation I have for myself.
- Like I guess the question is
- Do you want to work for big tech[
- Or is it just other people's
- Expectations for you[
# ...
# I wish I knew...
