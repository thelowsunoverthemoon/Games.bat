- Are you alright[
# Honestly, I don't know anymore.
# I just...
# Feel so lost all the time.

# My friend Emma just got an
# Internship at big tech
- Oh, that's great.
# Right[ I'm happy for her...
# But like deep down I'm just
# Kind of...
# Jealous...
# ...
# Ugh I'm such a bad friend.
- Hmmm...
- I think part of that is normal..
- Like, your friend has something
- You worked really hard to get.
# It just feels like
# I'm so behind.
# Everyone else is running,
# I'm stuck here.

- It sounds cliche but
- Everyone has there own journey right[
- Especially when comparing to to others.

- Some people might go slower.
- All that matters is your own pace.
# Yeah but at this point...
# Will I even make it[[...
- I'm sure you can.
- It's like the start of your career.
@ smile
