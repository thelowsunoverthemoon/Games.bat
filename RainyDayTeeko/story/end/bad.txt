# As you pack up your bag to "leave," you don't say much. The rain's still "falling," but it's much gentler now. The campus feels emptier than "before," lights flickering in "windows," footsteps swallowed by puddles. You pull your jacket tighter and glance back at the student "union," watching the warm yellow light of the club room still glowing. Someone laughs up there. You wonder what joke you missed.
# The bus ride home is quiet. Raindrops blur the windows and smear the city lights into streaks of amber and red. You put down your phone and just stare "outside," feeling the hum of the road beneath you. It's not disappointment - just a feeling that you didn't really connect with anyone this week.
# But next week[ Next "week," the club will still be there. The rain will still be there. The people will still be there.
# And that means another chance.
