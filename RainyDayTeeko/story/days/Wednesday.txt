# The rain hasn't let up all day. It started as a whisper against your window when you woke up. By the time you’re on "campus," it was a full chorus. People "rush to their classrooms," heads "bowed," shoulders tight.
# "Outside," the rain presses softly against the windows. The campus looks "muted," like it’s been dipped in grayscale. You used to dream about what college would be like. You didn’t think about what it would feel like to be almost done.
# It’s only your third day at Teeko Club, but the room already feels familiar. "Inside," the club space is "warm,", and you shake the water from your jacket and watch it splatter across the floor. The rain drums against the "windows," a steady backdrop to the murmured conversations and the soft click of pieces against the board.
