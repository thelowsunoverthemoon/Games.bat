Rules of Teeko
- Each turn, you can move any of your tokens (blue triangle) one step in any direction (cardinals + diagonals) not blocked by other tokens
- To do this, select your token with WASD and confirm it with P. Then you can move it to a valid position by using WASD and P again. To unconfirm a token, press P on itself.
- The goal of the game is to get your tokens into a line, column, diagonal, or square of 4.
- After you move, the enemy will move.
- Repeat until the game finishes
